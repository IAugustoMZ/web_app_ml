# Prediction of Stock Prices using Machine Learning

<br>

This is an application of Flask to deploy a solution developed for stock prices prediction. This project integrates the development of a web application and the application of a Machine Learning model.

The app works by using inputting stock candle information: opening price, high and low prices. These values are saved in a SQL database and sent to a LSTM neural model. The model predicts the close prices and saves the predictions in the database.
